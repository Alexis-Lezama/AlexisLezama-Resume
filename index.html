        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi I'm ALexis Lezama and I'm currently attending University of California Riverside. I was born in Los Angeles California on January 02, 2002 but came to Riverside in 2007. For the last couple of years I have been studying and making the most of High School because I wanted to further my education. In High School I Was in multiple clubs, sports and advanced placement classes. These past 4 years weren't the easiest for me but I never gave up. If I want to accomplish something I don't stop until I accomplish it. I would consider myself determined because no matter how hard things get I pull through and accomplish what I want to. Education means a lot to me because my family came to the United States to give me a better life. This was one of the reasons why I was determined to go onto a University but the other reason was for my own benefit. I know that things aren't easy in the world but we can accomplish whatever we want, only if we put our minds into it. I am not going to take what my parents did for granted because I'm going to do the most to be someone big in life. I hope to work for a big company in the future to get their products out there and get the company out there as well.<br><br>

        Getting into University Of California Riverside was a huge accomplishment for me because I want to have a degree in Business Marketing. I knew that the University of California Riverside  was the right school for me because it's close to home so I won't have to pay a lot for school. Not only that but their business school is pretty good so I know that they'll be able to teach me valuable things. I hope to graduate in 4 years and have a degree in business marketing. Throughout these next four years I'm going to build skills in order to become a good director of marketing.<br><br>

        I  knew that I wanted to do business marketing because I want to help my dad grow his company. My dad has owned his own business since 2011 and even though he's doing really good, I feel like his company can grow way more. For that reason I want to study marketing in order to get my dad's company out there. Within these next 4 years I am going to study hard and do multiple internships so that when I graduate I can find a job quick. After I get a few years of experience I'm going to help my dad with his company so that he can get big. Adding on, I hope to one day own a business myself because I don't like to work for people. I would love to be my own boss because I hate when people tell me what to do. I'm not sure what type of business I want to start up but I know that I want to have my own business.
